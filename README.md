# adventofcodeclojure

Advent of Code in Clojure.  The project is set up so I can add more years and still be able to run all of them, selectively, from the main function (see Examples).

## Installation

Clone this repo.  Requires Clojure and Leiningen.

## Usage

In the folder, run `lein run`.  Input the year and day you want to run.  Output will be printed as a map.

## Examples

`PS C:\Users\mikew\Projects\AdventOfCodeClojure> lein run

Input a day:

Running  advent-2019.day1 / day1
{:part1 3297896, :part2 4943969}`
